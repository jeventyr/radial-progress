# radial-progress
A circular progress bar for UI Builder using VectorAPI in Unity 2022.1 and higher

## installation
After downloading this to your project's Assets Folder, you can find this element in the UI Builder under Library > Project > Custom Controls (C#).

## instructions
This creates a progress circle in an arc with dimensions based on the smallest of the width or height of the element. You can set the line width, line color, and fill color attributes in the inspector. The progress attribute should be a value between 0 and 1 that represents how complete the circle is.

## notes
This was based on "Create a radial progress indicator" (https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/UIE-radial-progress.html) in the Unity Manual. I have updated it to use the VectorAPI that was introduced in Unity 2022.1.
